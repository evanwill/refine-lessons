OpenRefine is a powerful, flexible tool for exploring, cleaning, and transforming data. 
Evaluating the quality and consistency of data is an essential skill for humanities.
An earlier PH lesson introduced using Refine to efficiently discover and correct inconsistency in a data set, introducing the basic functionality of the tool.
This lesson focuses on Refine's ability to fetch urls and introduces some of the advance features to transform and enhance a data set. 
As seen in other PH lessons [wget], the ability to create data sets from unstructured documents available on the web opens unique possibilities for research. 
Because Refine is relatively user friendly and interactive, it is a great tool for doing this type of work. 
Refine allows fetching urls and processing the results into a clean data set in an iterative, exploratory manner.

"The user friendly interface helped thousands of non technical users to take control of their data." http://openrefine.org/2013/10/12/openrefine-history.html

Google Refine is a power tool for working with messy data, primarily for
• detecting and fixing inconsistencies
• transforming data from one structure or format to another
• connecting names within your data to name registries (databases)
Use Google Refine when you need something ...
• more powerful than a spreadsheet
• more interactive and visual than scripting
• more provisional / exploratory / experimental / playful than a database
