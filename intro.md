## Lesson Goals

OpenRefine "is a power tool for working with messy data" ([David Huynh](http://web.archive.org/web/20150528125345/http://davidhuynh.net/spaces/nicar2011/tutorial.pdf)) who's flexible, interactive workflow is ideal for humanities researchers to explore, clean, and transform data.
OpenRefine is a powerful tool for exploring, cleaning, and transforming data. 
An earlier [PH lesson](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine) introduced the basic functionality of OpenRefine to efficiently discover and correct inconsistency in a data set.
Building on those essential data skills, this lesson focuses on Refine's ability to fetch urls and parse web content.
Examples will introduce some of the advanced features to transform and enhance a data set. 

## Why Use OpenRefine

As seen in other PH lessons [wget](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/applied-archival-downloading-with-wget), the ability to create data sets from unstructured documents available on the web opens unique possibilities for research. 
Refine's flexible and interactive workflow make it particularly suited for this work, and it has been embraced by data journalists, librarians, and .
Because Refine is relatively user friendly and interactive, it is a great tool for doing this type of work. 
Refine allows fetching urls and processing the results into a clean data set in an iterative, exploratory manner.

"The user friendly interface helped thousands of non technical users to take control of their data." http://openrefine.org/2013/10/12/openrefine-history.html

"
Google Refine is a power tool for working with messy data, primarily for
• detecting and fixing inconsistencies
• transforming data from one structure or format to another
• connecting names within your data to name registries (databases)
Use Google Refine when you need something ...
- more powerful than a spreadsheet
- more interactive and visual than scripting
- more provisional / exploratory / experimental / playful than a database
